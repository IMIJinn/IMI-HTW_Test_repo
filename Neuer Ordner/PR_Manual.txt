In this exercise, you will practice altering file contents by creating a pull request (PR) on GitHub. Here are the steps to follow:

1) Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

2) Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

3) Open the files in a fitting editor. Or add new ones.

4) Make any changes you like to the files, such as adding your name, the date, or a message.

5) Save the changes and commit them to your local repository.

6) Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

7) Create a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository. In the pull request, provide a brief description of the changes you made to the file.

8) Wait for the owner of the original repository to review and merge your pull request.

Note: If you need a refresher on forking, cloning, and creating pull requests, check out the GitHub documentation on forking a repository (https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-the-basics/fork-a-repo) and creating a pull request (https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Good luck, and happy coding!
