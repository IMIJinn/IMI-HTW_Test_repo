In this file you are asked to cause merge conflicts.

---------- ChatGPT (short) ----------

Hello students!

Welcome to the GitHub exercise on merge conflicts. In this exercise, you will learn how to resolve conflicts that can arise when merging branches.


Eldaro is a KING!!


Hi i changed this here.

2. When you try to merge the branches, a conflict occurs because the same line in the file has been changed by both of you.

3. To resolve the conflict, you will need to edit the file and choose which change to keep or merge.

4. After resolving the conflict, commit the changes and push the branch to GitHub.

Good luck, and happy resolving!

Understanding Merge Conflicts in GitHub Exercises
GitHub is a powerful tool for collaboration and version control in software development. However, it's not uncommon for multiple people to make changes to the same file in separate branches, leading to a situation known as a "merge conflict." In this article, we'll explore what merge conflicts are, why they occur, and how to resolve them in the context of GitHub exercises.

What are Merge Conflicts?
A merge conflict occurs when two or more changes are made to the same lines of a file in separate branches, and Git is unable to automatically merge these changes. In other words, it's a situation where the changes made by one person conflict with the changes made by another person.

For example, imagine you and a colleague are both working on a file called file.txt, and you each make changes to different lines in the file. If you try to merge your branch with your colleague's branch, a conflict will occur because Git will not know which change to keep and which change to discard.

Why do Merge Conflicts Occur?
Merge conflicts occur when multiple people are making changes to the same file simultaneously. This can happen in a variety of scenarios, such as when two people are working on the same project, or when one person is making changes to a file in a branch while another person is making changes to the same file in the master branch.

The reason Git can't automatically merge these changes is because it doesn't have enough information to determine which change is the "correct" one. For example, it may not know which person's change should take priority or whether the changes should be combined in some way.

How to Resolve Merge Conflicts
Resolving merge conflicts can be a bit tricky, but it's a valuable skill to have in your toolkit as a software developer. The basic steps for resolving a merge conflict are as follows:

This is a new line in here. Lets see what it breaks.

1) Identify the conflict: The first step is to identify which file or files have conflicts. This information will usually be displayed in your Git client when you try to merge the branches.

2) Edit the file: Next, open the file with the conflict in a text editor and look for the conflict markers. Conflict markers are special comments in the file that indicate where the conflicting changes are.

3) Choose the changes to keep: Once you have identified the conflicting changes, you'll need to decide which changes to keep and which changes to discard. You can also choose to combine the changes in some way if that makes sense.

4) Commit the changes: After resolving the conflict, you'll need to commit the changes to your branch and push the branch to GitHub.

It's worth noting that resolving merge conflicts can sometimes be a time-consuming process, especially if multiple files are involved or if the changes are complex. However, with practice, you'll get faster and more confident at resolving conflicts.

Conclusion
In conclusion, merge conflicts are a common problem in software development, but they're also a valuable opportunity to practice your skills and become a better developer. Whether you're working on GitHub exercises or real-world projects, understanding merge conflicts and knowing how to resolve them will serve you well in your career as a software developer.
